## Hi, I’m Vishnu 👋

I’m interested in **embedded systems and robotics**, with a focus on
**firmware development and hardware controlled through code**.

I am building a strong foundation in **Embedded C and microcontrollers**
by learning bare-metal concepts and implementing hands-on projects.

### 🔧 Current Focus
- Embedded C programming
- Bare-metal microcontroller programming
- Robotics and sensor-based systems
- PCB design fundamentals

---

### 🛠 Technical Skills
- **Languages:** C (Embedded C – fundamentals to low-level concepts)
- **Microcontrollers:** Arduino / AVR (bare-metal concepts), STM32 (learning)
- **Hardware:** Sensors, motors, motor drivers, basic communication interfaces
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Arduino IDE, basic debugging tools

---

### 📂 Projects
- 🤖 **Line Follower Robot**  
  Designed and implemented motor control and sensor logic using microcontrollers.

- 🌐 **IoT-based Livestock Health Tracker**  
  Worked on sensor integration and data monitoring concepts.

*(More embedded and robotics projects in progress)*
